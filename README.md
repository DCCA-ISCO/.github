| [python-test-only.yml](workflow-templates/python-test-only.yml) | Testing and quality checks only, no deployment | Pull request validation, CI-only |
| [python-ci-cd-ssm.yml](workflow-templates/python-ci-cd-ssm.yml) | Complete CI/CD with SSM deployment | Full pipeline with automated deployment |

### Reusable Workflows

| Workflow | Description | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| [ssm-deploy-reusable.yml](workflows/ssm-deploy-reusable.yml) | Centralized SSM deployment logic | Called by other workflows |

## Pipeline Features

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Security Scanning**: pip-audit, safety, bandit
- **Code Quality**: flake8, pylint
- **Smoke Tests**: Application import validation
- **Dependency Verification**: Conflict detection

### Deployment
- **Password-less**: SSM-based deployment (no SSH/RDP)
- **Multi-Environment**: Development and production support
- **Automated Backups**: Pre-deployment backup creation
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment verification
- **Comprehensive Logging**: S3 and CloudTrail integration

### Security
- **CVE Detection**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **IAM Role-Based**: No credentials in code
- **Audit Trail**: Complete deployment tracking
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/prod configurations

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: AWS Setup (One-Time)
- [ ] Create IAM role for EC2 instances
- [ ] Attach role to target servers
- [ ] Verify SSM Agent running
- [ ] Create IAM user for GitHub Actions
- [ ] Create S3 bucket for SSM logs
- [ ] Set up application directory on servers

### Phase 2: GitHub Configuration
- [ ] Create GitHub Environments (development, production)
- [ ] Add repository secrets (AWS credentials, paths)
- [ ] Add environment secrets (instance IDs, hostnames)
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Set environment approval requirements

### Phase 3: Workflow Setup
- [ ] Select appropriate workflow template
- [ ] Copy to `.github/workflows/` in your repository
- [ ] Customize for your application
- [ ] Test with manual trigger
- [ ] Verify development deployment
- [ ] Enable production deployment after validation

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Test-Only Workflow

Copy `workflow-templates/python-test-only.yml` to your repository for CI without deployment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/tests.yml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
# ... (use template content)
```

### Example 2: Full CI/CD Pipeline

Copy `workflow-templates/python-ci-cd-ssm.yml` for complete pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [ dev, master ]
# ... (use template content)
```

### Example 3: Using Reusable Workflow

Reference the centralized deployment logic:

```yaml
# In your repository's workflow file
jobs:
  test:
    # ... your test steps

  deploy:
    needs: test
    uses: YOUR-ORG/.github/.github/workflows/ssm-deploy-reusable.yml@main
    with:
      branch-name: dev
      server-env: development
    secrets: inherit
```
